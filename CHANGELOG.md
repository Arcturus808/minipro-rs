## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Fuse/lock-bit editor** — interactive Config panel for reading and writing MCU fuses and lock bits with checkbox UI, hex value display, and direct hex input fields
- **Chip ID comparison** — reads chip ID and compares against expected value from database, with clear match/mismatch/no-expected-value messages
- **Package variant warning** — warns user when a package variant (e.g., `@DIP8`) is selected for flash operations, as these often have incorrect protocol configurations
- **Package variant chip ID handling** — skips misleading mismatch warnings for variants and suggests selecting the base device name instead
- **Lock-bit protection safeguards** — warns before read/write when lock bits are active, and detects read-protected chips after read operations
- **"Size diff" option** — `Error` / `Warn` / `Ignore` modes for handling file size mismatches during write operations
- **Auto-verify after write** — automatically verifies chip contents after write unless `Skip verify` is checked
- **Blank check status messages** — explicitly reports whether chip is blank or not blank with address
- **Erase success message** — explicitly confirms chip was erased successfully
- **Hex value display for fuses** — each fuse/lock byte shows its raw hex value next to its name
- **AVR fuse bit inversion** — checkbox state correctly reflects AVR convention where bit=0 means programmed
- **Progress callbacks** — `read_chip_to_bytes` returns `{ base64, stats }` with CRC-32 for hex viewer display

### Fixed

- **Tauri v2 command parameter naming** — fixed `write_fuses` and `save_bytes_to_file` commands where Tauri's auto-camelCase key mapping caused "missing required key" errors
- **`verify_chip` panic** — fixed panic when verifying a file smaller than the device memory (now pads with blank_value, matching `write_chip` behavior)
- **`doReadToBuffer` TypeError** — fixed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined` caused by mismatched return shape from `runOp`
- **Blank check as error** — changed "not blank" result from `[ERROR]` to `[INFO]` since a non-blank chip is a valid state
- **TL866A fuse read/write** — fixed missing `protocol_id` in fuse command messages and corrected `items_count` for multi-byte fuse operations

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **`-o KEY=VALUE` voltage/timing override** — passes raw device-parameter overrides to the
  programmer (e.g. `-o vpp=6.0 -o vcc=3.3`).  Multiple `-o` flags may be combined.
- **Individual long-form override options** — convenience aliases for the most common `-o` keys:
  - `--vpp V` — programming voltage
  - `--vcc V` — logic supply voltage
  - `--vdd V` — additional supply voltage
  - `--pulse US` — programming pulse width (microseconds)
  - `--spi_clock N` (also `--spi-clock`) — SPI clock divisor
  - `--address HEX` — starting address (decimal or `0x`-prefixed hex)
- **`--algorithms PATH`** — override the path to `algorithms.xml` (T56/T76 FPGA bitstream
  descriptions).  Searched via the same four-location fallback chain as `infoic.xml`.
- **`--logicic-out FILE`** — redirect logic IC test result table to a file instead of stdout.
- **`--fuses` / `--uid` / `--lock`** — page-selector shortcuts equivalent to
  `--page config` / `--page user` / `--page config` respectively; mirrors the upstream
  `minipro` 0.7.x interface.
- **Short flag aliases** — added the following short options present in upstream but previously
  missing: `-T` (logic-test), `-x` (no-size-error), `-y` (no-size-warning), `-P` (no-pin-check),
  `-u` (unsafe), `-f` (fill), `-F` (format), `-a` (start-address).
- **Progress callbacks for read/write/verify** — `read_chip`, `write_chip`, and `verify_chip` now
  accept an `Option<&mut dyn FnMut(usize, usize)>` progress callback invoked after each block
  with `(bytes_done, total_bytes)`.  Pass `None` for the original behaviour.  The CLI wires this
  to `indicatif` progress bars; a Tauri front-end can wire it to `window.emit("progress", …)`
  without any changes to `minipro-core`.
- **`OpStats` return value** — `read_chip` and `write_chip` now return `Result<OpStats>` instead
  of `Result<()>`.  `OpStats` carries `bytes: usize` and `crc32: u32` (CRC-32/ISO-HDLC of the
  data buffer).  The CLI prints these after each operation, e.g.
  `Saved "dump.bin"  (262144 bytes, CRC-32: 0xc56d40d3)`.
